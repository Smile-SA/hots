  cluster

    In the context of rac application, cluster is used for its *machine-learning* meaning (it could be confused with the meaning related to *infrastructure*). In this context, a cluster is a group of similar individuals, resulting from clustering.

  clustering

    Clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a *cluster*) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters).

  heuristic

    A heuristic is a method, used for solving a given problem, that is not guaranteed to be optimal, perfect or rational, but which is nevertheless sufficient for reaching an immediate, short-term goal. It is often used for solving very hard problems, by quickly finding a feasible solution.   

  rac

    *rac* is the name given (for the moment) to this application. *rac* comes from *Resource Allocation via Clustering*. It then denotes a methodology that solves a resource allocation problem, using clustering (in addition to a heuristic).
